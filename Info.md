# TacoMenu-The Ultimate SWF Library
The TacoMenu is a library of swf files that can be run in emulators like ruffle or in flasharch. 
Games like Papa's Pizzeria, Duck Life, Learn to Fly, many games that you can play even with flash being discontinued in late 2020.
Due to the size of the zip file, it cannot be uploaded to github itself, so, a google drive will be linked for the zip file.
